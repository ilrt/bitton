        <h2>Where does this data come from?</h2>

        <p>There are many sources of information in the research revealed system, some from internal University data sources, and others from public web sites.</p>
            
        <h3>Publications:</h3>
        <p>Publication data comes from the university's central publication repositories:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.iris.bris.ac.uk/">IRIS</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://rose.bris.ac.uk/dspace/">ROSE</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Grants:</h3>
        <p>For grant information, we use web crawlers to scape the webpages of various funding bodies. <p>
        <p>The research revealed system currently contains grant details from:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.epsrc.ac.uk">EPSRC</a> (Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council)</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.mrc.ac.uk/">MRC</a> (Medical Research Council)</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/">BBSRC</a> (Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council)</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.nerc.ac.uk/">NERC</a> (Natural Environment Research Council)</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>People:</h3>
        <p>Information about members of the University of Bristol come from the <a href="http://www.bris.ac.uk/is/faqs/datahub.html">DataHub</a> (an Oracle database which is populated from the university's administrative databases. It can be used to extract student and personnel data to a local source (for example, a report, list, spreadsheet or locally held database).</p>
        <p>Information about non-UoB members come from the Grants and Publication pages themselves (so usually only contain sparse information such as names and possibly email addresses).</p>

        <h3>Organisations (University of Bristol):</h3>
        <p>We obtain the organisational structure of the University from the aforementioned DataHub.</p>

        <h3>Organisations (non-UoB):</h3>
        <p>Information about organisations outside of the University are a by product of the public Grants and Publication data we gather.</p>

        <h3>Impacts:</h3>
        <p>Impact data is gathered from UoB staff using the <a href="http://resrev.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/caboto-rr/">Bookmarklet tool</a>.</p>
